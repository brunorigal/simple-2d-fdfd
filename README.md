# simple-2d-fdfd
Matlab fdfd code for computing the propagating field at a given wavelength in arbitrary 2D photonic crystal structures.

This project vastly benefitted from the great [computational electromagnetics course](https://04.phf-site.com/2016/10/raymond-c-rumpf-computational.html) by Pr. Rumpf.
